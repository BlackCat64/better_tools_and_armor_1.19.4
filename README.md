## Overview
Better Tools and Armor is a mod for **Forge/NeoForge** 1.19.4/1.20.1 which aims to improve Minecraft's progression system by encouraging exploration. Many new ores are added, each of which spawning in unique locations. Most ores have their own tool and armor set, which has a special gimmick.
e.g. A Sapphire Sword can freeze your opponents in their tracks!

BT+A also extends Minecraft's progression **beyond Netherite**, emphasising player freedom and choice. Once you have Netherite gear, you can choose to either go for Ender Titanium, or Crystallite, depending on your taste. Ender Titanium is the most powerful resource *overall* in the mod, while Crystallite can be **upgraded** in many ways to excel in **certain areas**!

BT+A also adds a whole heap of other features designed to fit somewhat well into Survival Minecraft.
